green day
Starry nights, city lights coming down over meSkyscrapers and stargazers in my headAre we we are, are we we are the waiting unknownThis dirty town was burning down in my dreamsLost and found, city bound in my dreamsAnd screamingAre we we are, are we we are the waitingAnd screamingAre we we are, are we we are the waitingForget-me-nots and second thoughts live in isolationHeads or tails and fairytales in my mindAre we we are, are we we are the waiting unknownThe rage and love, the story of my lifeThe Jesus of Suburbia is a lieAnd screamingAre we we are, are we we are the waitingAnd screamingAre we we are, are we we are the waiting unknownAre we we are, are we we are the waitingAnd screamingAre we we are, are we we are the waiting unknownAre we we are, are we we are the waiting unknown
