green day
<i>[Part I]</i>Born into Nixon, I was raised in hellA welfare child where the teamsters dwelledThe last one born and the first one to runMy town was blind from refinery sunMy generation is zeroI never made it as a working-class hero21st Century BreakdownI once was lost but never was foundI think I'm losing what's left of my mindTo the 20th century deadlineI was made of poison and bloodCondemnation is what I understoodVideo games of the towers fallHomeland security could kill us allMy generation is zeroI never made it as a working-class hero21st Century BreakdownI once was lost but never was foundI think I'm losing what's left of my mindTo the 20th century deadline<i>[Part II]</i>We are the class ofâ€”the class of '13Born in the era of humilityWe are the desperate in the declineRaised by the bastards of 1969My name is No One, the long lost sonBorn on the 4th of JulyRaised in the era of heroes and consThat left me for dead or aliveI am a nation, a worker of prideMy debt to the status quoThe scars on my hands and the means to an endIs all that I have to showI swallowed my pride and I choked on my faithI've given my heart and my soulI've broken my fingers and lied through my teethThe pillar of damage controlI've been to the edge and I've thrown the bouquetOf flowers left over the graveI sat in the waiting room wasting my timeAnd waiting for Judgement DayI praise libertyThe "Freedom to obey"It's the song that strangles meWell, don't cross the lineOh, dream, America, dreamI can't even sleepFrom the light's early dawnOh, scream, America, screamBelieve what you seeFrom heroes and cons
