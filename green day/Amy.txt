green day
Is your heart singing out of tune?Are your eyes just singing the blues?Dirty records from another timeSome blood stains on your shoesNo one really knows about your soulAnd I barely really know your nameBurning rhythms and posting liesAnd a bunch of fools drown in shameAmy don't you goI want you aroundSingin' woah please don't goDo you wanna be a friend of mine?Do you wanna be a friend of mine?Did you tattoo a lucky charmTo keep you out of harms way?Warding off all evil signsBut never really kept you safeNow you're too young for the golden age'Cause the record bin's been replaced27 gone without a traceAnd you walked away from your drinkAmy don't you goI want you aroundSingin' woah please don't goDo you wanna be a friend of mine?Do you wanna be a friend of...Amy please don't go!Amy please don't go!Is your heart singing out of tuneAre your eyes just singing the blues?Dirty records from another timeSome blood stains on your shoesMay I have this last danceBy chance if we should meet?Can you write me a lullaby?So we can sing you to sleepAmy don't you goI want you aroundSingin' woah please don't goDo you wanna be a friend of mine?Do you wanna be a friend of mine?Do you wanna be a friend of mine?
