Modern World]</i>I don't wanna live in the modern world! <i>[4x]</i>I'm the class of '13In the era of dissentA hostage of the soulOn a strike to pay the rentThe last of the rebelsWithout a common groundI'm gonna light a fireInto the undergroundI don't wanna live in the modern world! <i>[4x]</i>I am a nation without bureaucratic tiesDeny the allegation as it's written fucking lies!I want to take a ride to the great divideBeyond the "up to date" and the neo-gentrifiedThe high definition for the low residentWhere the value of your mind is not held in contemptI can hear the sound of a beating heartThat bleeds beyond a system that's falling apartWith money to burn on a minimum wageWell, I don't give a shit about the modern ageI don't wanna live in the modern world! <i>[4x]</i>I don't wanna live in the modern world!
