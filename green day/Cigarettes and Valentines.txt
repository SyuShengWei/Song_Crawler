green day
I don't wanna go back homeI don't wanna kiss goodnightLet us paralyze this moment'til it diesTo the end of the earthUnder the valley of the starsThere's a car crashingDeep inside my heartTake a ride to the avenuesAcross the Great DivideThere's a siren screaming"I'm alive", it criesRed alert is the colorOf your paper valentinesIntertwined on this momentPassing byTake a ride through the avenuesAcross the Great DivideThere's a siren screaming"I'm alive", it criesRed alert is the colorOf your paper valentinesIntertwined on this momentPassing byOh, come away with me tonightWith cigarettes and valentinesCigarettes and Valentines!So, come away with me tonightWith cigarettes and valentinesOh, come away with me tonightWith cigarettes and valentinesCigarettes and Valentines!
