Do you know what's worth fighting forWhen it's not worth dying for?Does it take your breath awayAnd you feel yourself suffocatingDoes the pain weigh out the pride?And you look for a place to hideDid someone break your heart insideYou're in ruinsOne, 21 GunsLay down your armsGive up the fightOne, 21 GunsThrow up your arms into the skyYou and I...When you're at the end of the roadAnd you lost all sense of controlAnd your thoughts have taken their tollWhen your mind breaks the spirit of your soulYour faith walks on broken glassAnd the hangover doesn't passNothing's ever built to lastYou're in ruinsOne, 21 GunsLay down your armsGive up the fightOne, 21 GunsThrow up your arms into the skyYou and I...Did you try to live on your ownWhen you burned down the house and homeDid you stand too close to the fire?Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stoneWhen it's time to live and let dieAnd you can't get another trySomething inside this heart has diedYou're in ruinsOne, 21 GunsLay down your armsGive up the fightOne, 21 GunsThrow up your arms into the skyOne, 21 GunsLay down your armsGive up the fightOne, 21 GunsThrow up your arms into the skyYou and I
