green day
Year of the rat, last of the litterSomebody shot the babysitterThey say my middle name is DangerThe kind to keep away from strangersI say woah, I'm out of controlOh baby, when I see your pretty face?I say woah, God rest your fucking soul'Cause baby, baby I was born to killI pulled the trigger from the shooting starsI am the motor in your crashing carI am the cherub in the Arab springI am the bullet in your magazineI say woah, I'm out of controlOh baby, when I see your pretty face?I say woah, God rest your fucking soul'Cause baby, baby eyesOh baby, baby eyesOh baby, baby I was born to... Kill!
