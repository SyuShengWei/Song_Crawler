green day
Hey there lookin' at meTell me what do you seeBut you quickly turn your head awayTry to find the words I could useDon't have the courage to come up to youMy chance is looking a bit greyStaring across the roomAre you leaving soon?I just need a little timeWhat is it that drives me madGirls like you that I never hadWhat is it about you that I adore?What makes me feel so much pain?That makes me go so insaneWhat is it about you that I adore?Staring across the roomAre you leaving soon?I just need a little time (what time, ah!)Why did you have to leave so soon?Why did you have to walk away?Oh, well, it happened againShe walked away with her boyfriendMaybe we'll meet again someday.Maybe we'll meet again someday.Maybe we'll meet again someday.Someday
