green day
Do you have the timeTo listen to me whineAbout nothing and everythingAll at onceI am one of thoseMelodramatic foolsNeurotic to the boneNo doubt about itSometimes I give myself the creepsSometimes my mind plays tricks on meIt all keeps adding upI think I'm cracking upAm I just paranoid?Am I just stoned?I went to a shrinkTo analyze my dreamsShe says it's lack of sexThat's bringing me downI went to a whoreHe said my life's a boreSo quit my whining causeIt's bringing her downSometimes I give myself the creepsSometimes my mind plays tricks on meIt all keeps adding upI think I'm cracking upAm I just paranoid?Uh, yuh, yuh, yaGrasping to controlSo I better hold onSometimes I give myself the creepsSometimes my mind plays tricks on meIt all keeps adding upI think I'm cracking upAm I just paranoid?Am I just stoned?
