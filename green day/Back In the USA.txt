green day
I woke up to a bitter storm (bitter year)And Noah's Ark came washed up on the shoreThe riot gear has lined the dawn (bitter year)Like dogs that shit on your neighbor's lawnLet freedom ring with all the crazies on paradeLet them eat poison and it tastes like lemonadeBack in the USA for a small town serenadeWith fireworks on displayTonight, it's a hero's welcome homeAnd there's no place else to goAnd I'm takin' it to the graveBack in the USAThe saddest story ever told (bitter year)Is feeling safe in our suburban homesLike soldiers of an endless war (bitter year)And every church can have a liquor storeLet freedom ring with all the crazies on paradeLet them eat poison and it tastes like lemonadeBack in the USA for a small town serenadeWith fireworks on displayTonight, it's a hero's welcome homeAnd there's no place else to goAnd I'm takin' it to the graveBack in the USA
