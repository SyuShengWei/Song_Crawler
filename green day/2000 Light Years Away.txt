green day
I sit alone in my bedroomStaring at the wallsI've been up all damn night longMy pulse is speedingMy love is yearningI hold my breath and close my eyes and...Dream about herCause she's 2000 light years awayShe holds my malachite so tight so...Never let goCause she's 2000 light years awayYears Away!I sit outside and watch the sunriseLookout as far as I canI can't see her, but in the distanceI hear some laughter,We laugh togetherI hold my breath and close my eyes and...Dream about herCause she's 2000 light years awayShe holds my malachite so tight so...Never let goCause she's 2000 light years awayYears Away!I sit alone in my bedroomStaring at the wallsI've been up all damn night longMy pulse is speedingMy love is yearningI hold my breath and close my eyes and...Dream about herCause she's 2000 light years awayShe holds my malachite so tight so...Never let goCause she's 2000 light years away
