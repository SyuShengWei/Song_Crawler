green day
I'm in another state, another state of mindI wish that I could be there right next to herWell, this road leads to this, and this one leads to thatHer voice sends shivers down my spineThese scars in my fleshI'm bruised and I'm bloodiedOnly she knows the painThat I've been throughTalk to her a thousand miles awayThere's tears in her eyesIf I make it back I'm gonna show herShe's the only one for meHitch a ride on the wild sideIt's real hell on wheelsThere's gonna be a fight tonightI knowAnother city we can't findAnother city left buried behindAs I picture herThe cities burn awayThese scars in my fleshI'm bruised and I'm bloodiedOnly she knows the painThat I've been throughTalk to her a thousand miles awayThere's tears in her eyesIf I make it back I'm gonna show herShe's the only one for meThese scars in my fleshI'm bruised and I'm bloodiedOnly she knows the painThat I've been throughTalk to her a thousand miles awayThere's tears in her eyesIf I make it back I'm gonna show herShe's the only one for me
