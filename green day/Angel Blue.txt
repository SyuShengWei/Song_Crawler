green day
Gonna build it up just to burn it downYou're a princess, I'm a fucking clownStop the presses cause I'm killing timeWon't you be my bloody valentineYou're just a fucking kidAnd no one ever gives you a breakYou want a señoritaAnd now your heart is gonna breakYou're angel blueWith teenage tracesAngel blueWith pretty facesStab my heart like a stick in the mudCut my chest just to see the bloodNow I'm singing out the alphabetAs the tears are putting out my cigaretteWe'll hit the cemetary so we can see the holiday lightsWaking up the dead and everything'll be alrightYou're angel blueWith teenage tracesAngel blueWith pretty facesAlrightStuck in the middle of Heaven and HellAlrightTrying to find my better angelsStab my heart like a stick in the mudCut my chest just to see the bloodStop the presses cause I'm killing timeWon't you be my bloody valentineYou're just a fucking kidAnd no one ever gives you a breakYou want a señoritaAnd now your heart is gonna breakYou're angel blueWith teenage tracesAngel blueWith pretty faces
