green day
Concrete dream (Hey!)I'm gonna make a sceneThe radioCovered in gasolineSleeping in reverseAnd everybody's bouncing off the wallsBombs away (Hey!)It's just another dayOf idle threatsThe secret alphabetAnd I wouldn't sweat itEverybody's bouncing off the wallsI'm bouncing off the wallsAlrightConcrete kiss (Hey!)Come on and do the twistThe radioMy little exorcistWe're all getting pissedAnd everybody's bouncing off the wallsI'm bouncing off the walls'Cause it's all that I wantAnd I want to be freeI got Satan riding next to me'Cause we're all bloody freaksAnd we'll give you the creepsChasing fireflies and zeroes'Cause it's all that I wantAnd I want to be freeI got Satan riding next to me'Cause we're all bloody freaksAnd we'll give you the creepsChasing fireflies and zeroes
