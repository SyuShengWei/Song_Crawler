green day
I don't know youBut I think I hate youYou're the reason for my miseryStrange how you've becomeMy biggest enemyAnd I've never even seen your faceMaybe it's just jealousyMixing up with a violent mindA circumstance that doesn't make much senseOr maybe I'm just dumbYou're the cloud hanging out over my headHail comes crashing downWelting my faceMagic man,Egocentric plastic manYet you still get one over on meMaybe it's just jealousyMixing up with a violent mindA circumstance that doesn't make much senseOr maybe I'm just dumbI'm a chump!
