green day
Dreaming, I was only dreamingOf another place and timeWhere my family's fromSinging, I can hear them singingWhen the rain had washed awayAll these scattered dreamsDying, everyone's remindedHearts are washed in miseryDrenched in gasolineLaughter, there is no more laughterSongs of yesterday now live in the undergroundLife before the lobotomyChristian sang the eulogySign my love a lost memoryFrom the end of the centuryWell it's enough to make you sickTo cast a stone and throw a brickBut when the sky is falling downIt burned your dreams into the groundChristian's lesson's what he's been sold (Hey!)We are normal and self-controlled (Hey!)Remember to learn to forget (Hey!)Whiskey shots and cheap cigarettesWell I'm not stoned, I'm just fucked upI got so high, I can't stand upWell, I'm not cursed 'cause I've been blessedI'm not in love 'cause I'm a messLike refugeesWe're lost like refugeesLike refugeesWe're lost like refugeesThe brutality of realityIs the freedom that keeps me fromDreaming, I was only dreamingOf another place and timeWhere my family's fromSinging, I can hear them singingWhen the rain had washed away all these scattered dreamsDying, everyone's remindedHearts are washed in miseryDrenched in gasolineLaughter, there is no more laughterSongs of yesterdayNow live in the underground
