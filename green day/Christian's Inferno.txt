green day
I got under the gripBetween this modern hellI got the rejection letter in the mailAnd it's already ripped to shredsSeasons in ruin and this bitter pill is chased in bloodThere's fire in my veins and it's pouring out like a floodWhoa! Christian's Inferno!Whoa! Christian's Inferno!Whoa! Christian's Inferno!Whoa! Christian's Inferno!This diabolic state is gracing my existenceLike a catastrophic babyMaybe,maybe you're the chemical reactionI am the atom bombI am your chosen oneToxin your reservoirAnd then return man to apeWhoa! Christian's Inferno!Whoa! Christian's Inferno!Whoa! Christian's Inferno!Whoa! Christian's Inferno!Ha-ha-haWhoa! Christian's Inferno!Whoa! Christian's Inferno!Whoa! Christian's Inferno!Whoa! Christian's Inferno!
